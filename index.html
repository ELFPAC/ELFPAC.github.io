    <h2><b>ELFPAC Now</b></h2>
    <p>
      Currently, ELFPAC is working on fundraising and contacting members of Congress
      in order to advance its goal of increasing young voter turnout in Colorado.
      We are developing print media to distribute which describes the legislative issues
      being discussed and voted on currently.

    <h2><b>About Us</b></h2>
    <p>
      ELFPAC, or Engaging Leaders of the Future PAC, is a political action committee
      dedicated to increasing the number of young voters who go to the polls each election
      cycle. ELFPAC was founded in November 2017 both to increase voter turnout, as well as to
      explore the intricaciesof creating a PAC, and to offer the public more insight
      into the regulations regarding PACs and the process of creating one. If we can have
      any measurable positive impact on the voter turnout rates of people aged 18-24 in
      Denver in 2017, then we will have been successful. We believe that when more people vote, we create a more representative democracy.
      Historically, people aged 18-24 have had the lowest turnout rates, and since the decisions
      beimg made have a potentially dramatic and long term effect on their lives, something must
      be done.
