      <h1><b>What is ELFPAC?</b></h1>
      <p>
        ELFPAC, or Engaging Leaders of the Future PAC, is a political action committee
        dedicated to increasing the number of young voters who go to the polls each election
        cycle. ELFPAC was founded in November 2017 both to increase voter turnout, as well as to
        explore the intricacies of creating a PAC, and to offer the public more insight
        into the regulations regarding PACs and the process of creating one. If we can have
        any measurable positive impact on the voter turnout rates of people aged 18-24 in
        Denver in 2018, then we will have been successful. We believe that when more people vote, we create a more representative democracy.
        Historically, people aged 18-24 have had the lowest turnout rates, and since the decisions
        being made have a potentially dramatic and long term effect on their lives, something must
        be done.
